      "content": "The Gist: Basically, the industry is eyeing VR to solve the \"engagement\" problem. Traditional sweepstakes can feel a bit flat since you're just clicking a screen, so they’re looking at VR to create 3D casino floors where you can walk around as an avatar and chat with other players via voice. The Pros: Social Connection: It turns solo gaming into a social hangout, which is a big deal for the \"social casino\" vibe. New Revenue: Operators are looking at selling digital \"extras\" (like avatar skins or VIP table access) rather than just coin packs. Better Data: They can track exactly what players look at and interact with in a 3D space to tweak the games. The Reality Check: The article is pretty honest about the hurdles. Most people don't own high-end VR headsets yet, and \"tech nausea\" (motion sickness) is still a thing. Plus, it’s expensive for devs to build these worlds, and if the player base isn't there, the ROI is shaky. Verdict: It's likely not going to replace your mobile sweepstakes apps anytime soon because of the \"convenience factor,\" but we’ll probably see more hybrid AR (Augmented Reality) features popping up first since everyone already has a smartphone. TL;DR: VR is definitely coming to sweepstakes for the \"wow\" factor, but hardware costs mean it'll stay a niche for a while.

At the same time I have always wanted to have children, but life circumstances makes it irresponsible and dangerous for me to have them. I have multiple chronic diseases, one of which might kill me and a pregnancy might as well. They are also inherited, so my child would be likely to have it as well, and I can’t justify that. Don’t get me wrong I have a great life, but I don’t want anyone else to have to deal with the same shit I’ve been through. I have somewhat come to terms with it and luckily my boyfriend is childfree by choice, so full support there. But I still find it very hard when people who know I want children talk about my future children who will not exist. Any tips to navigate that without making awkward situations? submitted by /u/Internal_Rough to r/childfreewomen [link] [comments]",

Thirdly and finally, do you think they will ever actually add knights?

I’m also asking this question with the knowledge that this is nowhere near something on their radar or concern nor should it be, I’m simply dreaming of what could be and how it could look (hopefully).

The demo offers around 20 minutes of gameplay, and I highly encourage you to try to play it until the end. This really helps with visibility on Steam, and more importantly - it helps me understand how the game feels from a player’s perspective. Lost Host is a small atmospheric game about a toy car searching for its missing boy (its owner). You’ll explore environments, solve light puzzles, push and carry small objects, and jump your way through the world. I’d describe it as a mystical exploration-focused experience. This is an almost-solo project, so I’d really appreciate any feedback, bug reports, or suggestions. If you enjoy it, sharing the demo somewhere would mean a lot - especially since today (Jan 15) is also my birthday :3 submitted by /u/Additional_Bug5485 [link] [comments]",
